# User Equipment Tracking Beamforming Using a MIMO Software-Defined Radio

## Introduction

* Beamforming as a tool used in 5G and modern Wifi. (1.1)
* Beamforming application using a low-cost hardware. (1.2)
* Present the challenges of implementing digital beamforming on-target. (2.1.3, 2.3)

## Beamformer Algorithm

* Present the equations of a narrowband beamformer. (2.1.2)
* Simulink implementation of such equations (3.2.4)

## DOA Algorithm

* Music seems to be the most popular and simple to explain. (Reference Sony & Quynh)
* Simulink implementation of MUSIC DOA estimator. (3.2.4)

## Hardware Implememtation

* Present the BladeRF 2.0 A4. (2.2.3)
    * Summarise common features found on SDR 
    * Focus on MIMO features
* Hardware Considerations (2.3)
    * Channel coherence (2.3.1)
    * Data throughput (2.3.2)
